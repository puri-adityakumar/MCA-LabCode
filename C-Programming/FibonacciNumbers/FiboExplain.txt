##Fibonacci Numbers
Fibonacci numbers, also known as the Fibonacci sequence, are a series of numbers in which each number (after the first two) is the sum of the two preceding ones. The sequence starts with 0 and 1, so the first few Fibonacci numbers are:

0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, ...

Each number in the sequence is called a Fibonacci number. The sequence was first introduced to the West by Leonardo of Pisa, an Italian mathematician from the Middle Ages, and it has since been studied extensively in mathematics and found applications in various fields, including computer science, finance, and art.

Example:
Let's generate the first few Fibonacci numbers to illustrate how the sequence is constructed:

Start with the first two numbers, which are always 0 and 1.

Fibonacci(0) = 0
Fibonacci(1) = 1
To find the next number (Fibonacci(2)), add the two preceding numbers (0 + 1), resulting in 1.

Fibonacci(2) = 1
Continue this process to find the next numbers:

Fibonacci(3) = Fibonacci(1) + Fibonacci(2) = 1 + 1 = 2
Fibonacci(4) = Fibonacci(2) + Fibonacci(3) = 1 + 2 = 3
Fibonacci(5) = Fibonacci(3) + Fibonacci(4) = 2 + 3 = 5
And so on...
The Fibonacci sequence goes on infinitely, and each number is generated by adding the two previous numbers in the sequence.
